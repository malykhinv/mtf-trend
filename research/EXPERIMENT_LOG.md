# Anomaly Experiment Log

Compact active experiment log for anomaly-first research.

Retired strategy experiments were removed from active research memory in P129 because they are no longer an executable strategy contract. Preserve old external run archives separately if forensic comparison is needed.

---

## Current experiment policy

Do not claim edge from a single run. Every experiment should record:

```text
period
symbols
cache/data availability
entry method
exit rule
trade count
average trade
winrate
monthly distribution
top-trade dependence
main reject reasons
known leakage/data-quality risks
```

If real trade-count or quote-volume is missing, write that conclusions about anomaly nature are limited.

---

## Next experiment

Run a small anomaly-lab smoke after applying P123-P129:

```bash
python main.py run-anomaly-lab --days 3 --timeframe 1m --run-entry-grid false
```

Goal:

```text
confirm current anomaly CLI runs after cleanup
confirm cache/data-quality statuses are explicit
confirm no retired strategy imports are required
```

Expected output:

```text
anomaly run directory
summary metrics
reject/status distribution
no hidden fallback for core evidence
```

## 2026-05-11 — NVDA micro-live execution audit

Input:

```text
Run artifact: 20260511_134124
Symbol: NVDA/USDT:USDT
Observed issue: plotted entry time near live order handling, but entry price from older signal close
```

Conclusion:

```text
The position is invalid for edge/PnL measurement.
The runner selected an old backfilled signal and then recorded/managed the trade using signal entry price instead of verified exchange fill.
A live-realistic backtest must not enter at decision close for market entries.
```

Action:

```text
P130 proposed: strict fill resolution, stale/executability rejects, actual-fill PnL/TP/BE, and execution-candle market backtest.
```
