# Anomaly Research State

Compact project memory. Detailed rules live in Project Instructions.

---

## 1. Current state

```text
Branch: codex/ideal-like from uploaded ZIP
Commit: UNKNOWN
Local patch stack: P123-P131 proposed locally on top of ZIP-derived source
Last active patch: P131 live blocked-order Telegram alerts
Updated: 2026-05-11
```

The project direction is anomaly-first: anomaly nature/category research, anomaly continuation backtests, and strict REST-only micro-live validation.

---

## 2. Active system thesis

```text
abnormal activity -> nature/category check -> controlled continuation -> executable entry -> managed exit
```

The edge is not assumed. The current task is to identify which anomaly categories are tradable, which are exhausted/fake/thin/late, and which should be rejected before expensive backtests.

---

## 3. Reliability priority

```text
data availability > leakage safety > execution realism > edge stability > parameter optimization
```

No strong conclusion about anomaly nature without real trade-count and quote-volume evidence available at decision time.

---

## 4. Current code status

```text
Active CLI:
fetch-data
update-cache
run-anomaly-lab
run-anomaly-live
check-quality
clear-cache
```

Runtime strategy path:

```text
research_tools/anomaly_config.py
research_tools/anomaly_strategy_backtest.py
research_tools/anomaly_micro_live.py
research_tools/charting.py
```

## 5. Open risks

1. Anomaly live/backtest logic still needs robustness evaluation across months and regimes.
2. Micro-live execution has real slippage, spread, partial fills and operational failure modes.
3. OI/derivatives context availability can limit category classification.
4. The 2026-05-11 NVDA micro-live position is audit-invalid for edge/PnL: stale signal execution mixed signal close with later live order timing.
5. `main.py` still has a known Linux `ctypes.windll` import issue; intentionally not fixed in the current cleanup stack.
6. Historical local artifacts may contain stale compiled files; they are ignored by git and should be deleted locally.

---

## 6. Next best step

Apply P131 and run the live-execution smoke before using any micro-live PnL:

```bash
python -m compileall data/exchanges research_tools cli constants.py main.py
# synthetic/fake-exchange check: stale/drift rejects must emit Telegram event notifications and no market order
```


---

## 7. Current audit note

P130 compiled and addressed the main live-execution bug, but second review found one remaining realism issue: entry drift must be absolute, not only positive. P131 fixes that and adds Telegram event notifications for stale/non-executable selected signals.

---

## 8. Current audit note — P132

P132 is proposed after P130/P131. Entry selection is no longer the only audit risk: position protection and exit accounting must also be strict. Live now treats unknown stop/fill/monitor data as explicit artifact events and integrity errors instead of temporary noise. Backtest artifacts now export skip-reason distribution so reduced trade count is explainable.

Next verification:

```bash
python -m compileall data/exchanges research_tools cli constants.py main.py
# fake-exchange smoke: stop verification failure, TP1 verified fill, repeated empty monitor OHLCV
```
