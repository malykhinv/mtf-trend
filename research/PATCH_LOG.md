# Anomaly Patch Log

Compact active patch log for the anomaly-first source tree. Retired strategy history was removed from active research memory in P129 to avoid stale contracts controlling current work.

## P129 — Purge retired strategy history from active memory

Status: PROPOSED
Date: 2026-05-11
Commit: UNKNOWN

### Reason

After removing the retired source path, the active research memory still contained extensive historical entries for the previous strategy. Those entries were no longer executable and could keep steering new work toward stale assumptions.

### Change

- Rewrite `README.md` as anomaly-only project documentation.
- Rewrite `research/RESEARCH_STATE.md` around current anomaly runtime paths and risks.
- Rewrite `research/STRATEGY_SPEC.md` as the current anomaly strategy contract.
- Reset `research/PATCH_LOG.md` to a compact active patch log for the current source tree.
- Reset `research/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` to anomaly-only experiment tracking.

### Validation

```bash
git grep -n -i -E 'retired_strategy_token|old_strategy_token|old_sizing_token' -- .
python -m compileall cli config constants.py research_tools vectorbt_runner strategy main.py
```

### Risk

Medium for project memory: detailed historical notes are intentionally removed from the active repo. Source behavior is unchanged.

## P130 — Strict live fills and executable market entry

Status: PROPOSED
Date: 2026-05-11
Commit: UNKNOWN

### Reason

NVDA live audit showed a signal price/time and execution price/time mismatch: a stale backfilled signal could be selected several minutes after its decision candle, while ledger, PnL and chart still used the signal close as entry. That makes live PnL and edge evidence invalid.

### Change

- Add typed exchange fill boundary: market entry must resolve order id, timestamp, average price and filled amount through exchange order/trade payloads.
- Reject live entries when signal is stale, live price drift is too high, TP1 is already reached, RR to signal TP1 collapsed, or exchange already has a position for the symbol.
- Ledger and chart now separate `signal_entry_price` from actual `entry_price`; TP1/BE/PnL are based on actual fill.
- Stop replacement verifies the new stop is open and does not silently ignore old-stop cancellation state.
- Market backtest no longer enters at decision close; it enters on the configured execution candle and rejects drift/RR-collapsed cases.

### Validation

```bash
python -m compileall data/exchanges research_tools cli constants.py main.py
```

### Risk

Medium: live will reject more signals and backtest results for `entry_method=market` will change. This is intended; old behavior was optimistic and non-executable.

## P131 — Live blocked-order Telegram alerts

Status: PROPOSED
Date: 2026-05-11
Commit: UNKNOWN

### Reason

P130 blocks stale and non-executable selected live signals, but the operator would only see those decisions in `live_events.csv` unless watching artifacts. Second review also found the drift guard was one-sided: it rejected only positive drift, while a selected signal could still be bought after price moved too far below the signal entry.

### Change

- Send Telegram event-channel alerts for `reject_stale_signal` and live executability rejects: invalid live price, TP1 already reached, invalid/wide live risk, entry price drift, and RR collapsed.
- Keep artifact events as source of truth; Telegram is only an operator notification queued through the existing dispatcher.
- Change live and market-backtest entry-price drift from one-sided positive drift to absolute drift around the signal entry.

### Validation

```bash
python -m compileall data/exchanges research_tools cli constants.py main.py
# synthetic smoke: stale signal and absolute drift reject enqueue Telegram event and create no market order
```

### Risk

Low/medium: fewer fresh-but-dislocated live entries pass, and Telegram event channel can receive more messages. Existing Telegram cooldown key is per symbol/event.
